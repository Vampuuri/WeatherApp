# WeatherApp
An iOS application that tells the weather. Done as a school project.

The goal of this mini project was to test our iOS programming skills.
The app contains fetching data from a source and using both storyboards and code to build and modify UI.

Weather data was fetched from Open Weather Map: https://openweathermap.org/

FEATURES:
- Three tabs: current weather, forecast and city
- Uses GPS to find the most accurate weather data
- Weather can be found both by GPS or by city
- Saves weather data to files in cache
- Preferred city/using GPS saved to User Preferences
- User can add, delete and modify cities of which weather they want to know
- Icons for different weather types
